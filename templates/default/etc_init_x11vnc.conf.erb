#enable flags in alphabetical order (there's alot of them)
# -auth = The Xauthority file for the VNC server
# -display = X11 server display to connect to, usually :0
# -forever = means even if you disconnect from your session, x11vnc will still be alive
# -o = Write stderr messages to file "logfile" instead of to the terminal.
# -repeat = is allowing keyboard repeating keys (most annoying thing when it doesnâ€™t work)
# -reopen = If the X server connection is disconnected, try to reopen the X display (up to one time.)
# -rfbauth = use authentication on RFB protocol
# -rfbport = TCP port for RFB protocol
# -xkb = will allow better clipboard interactions
