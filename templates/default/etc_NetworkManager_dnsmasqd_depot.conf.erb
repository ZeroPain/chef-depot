# Configuration file for dnsmasq.
#
# Format is one option per line, legal options are the same
# as the long options legal on the command line. See
# &quot;/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --help&quot; or &quot;man 8 dnsmasq&quot; for details.

# The following two options make you a better netizen, since they
# tell dnsmasq to filter out queries which the public DNS cannot
# answer, and which load the servers (especially the root servers)
# uneccessarily. If you have a dial-on-demand link they also stop
# these requests from bringing up the link uneccessarily.

# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
domain-needed
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.

# Add local-only domains here, queries in these domains are answered
# from /etc/hosts or DHCP only.

# you can specify which adddress to listen to (remember to include 127.0.0.1 if
# you use this.)
